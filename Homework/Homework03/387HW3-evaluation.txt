Comments:
---------
Q1:  what a great diagram in your code!!  That's the only time I've ever seen
THAT in a response to this question!  Very nice.

Q2: Good analysis of the situation.  You don't describe how your program will
keep one philosopher from putting down both forks and immediately picking them
up again, though.  But still, well done!

Q5: Good explanation on this one.

Excellent job on this work!
