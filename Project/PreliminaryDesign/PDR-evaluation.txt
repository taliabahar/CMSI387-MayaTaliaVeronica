CMSI 387 Operating Systems
   Semester Project
===================================

"qotd" would be a wonderful project!  Your plan to implement it
as a kernel command is a very good use of the idea.

I think a good way to go about this would be to write the utility
itself first, then figure out how to add it as a command to the
Linux command list.  Basing it off the fortune program is also a
good way to get started.  I have written my own version of that
program in "C" and it is good practice for coding in that language.
Also, getting the date from the system would be a system call that
will integrate the new utility with the kernel.

Nice idea!!

Project approved.  Good work and good luck!
